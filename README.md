# fnirs-Brain-Modelling
Analyzed HbO‚ÇÇ time-series signals from fNIRS to model cortical activation differences between Parkinson‚Äôs phenotypes (TD vs. PIGD). Used Python, MNE-NIRS, and GLM to identify region-specific hypoactivation and explore early markers of motor-cognitive interference.

This project analyzes cortical activation differences between Parkinson‚Äôs disease phenotypes ‚Äî Tremor Dominant (TD) and Postural Instability Gait Disorder (PIGD) ‚Äî using fNIRS-based HbO‚ÇÇ time-series signals. The goal is to identify phenotype-specific patterns of cortical hypoactivation that may serve as early neural markers for motor-cognitive interference and gait freezing.

We used MNE-NIRS and General Linear Models (GLM) to model hemodynamic responses across regions of interest (SMA, PFC, PMC), based on REDCap-exported datasets. Visualizations, signal preprocessing, and statistical modeling were implemented in Python. Results support the hypothesis of phenotype-driven brain remodeling in early-stage Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.
